# 🐍 Python
It's simple, easy, and understandable for beginners. Python has syntax that is similar to English. It's interpreted language, so it's not so fast for big project but efficient for simple task.

### Where to code? 👨‍💻
---
You can install the interpreter at [Python's official website](https://python.org), then run your script by typing this in the CLI:
```
python your_file.py
```
Alternatively if you don't have the interpreter, you can try to code Python on [Google Colab's website](https://colab.google). GColab has some pre-installed libraries such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`, but lacks of file operation method.
